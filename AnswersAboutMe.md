# Answers About Me

1. **_How many years have you been working in Front-End development?_**  
   I've been working in front-end development for about 5 years, with a strong focus on modern JavaScript and UI/UX best practices.

2. **_Have you worked with React before? What do you think about it?_**  
   Yes, I have. I enjoy React’s component-based architecture. It’s powerful, flexible, and works really well for building scalable front-end applications.

3. **_How much time did you spend developing this project?_**  
   Approximately 2–3 working days, including setup, coding, debugging, and styling.

4. **_What is the last technical book or learning resource you studied?_**  
   I usually read articles from Medium, which gets updated every Monday. And if I have a question about something specific, I either search for it or solve it using YouTube tutorials.

5. **_Why did you choose Matiran?_**  
   I actually don’t have prior knowledge about Matiran — it’s one of the companies I sent my resume to, in hopes of changing my workplace and getting familiar with new environments, teammates, and technologies.

6. **_What is the most challenging problem you have solved in front-end development?_**  
   One of my challenges was implementing a tree structure for a project with large datasets, where I couldn't update each node live due to performance issues. So I applied changes on the front-end first to reflect updates immediately for the user.  
   Another challenge was implementing multi-step forms that shared large amounts of data between steps. Since each step wasn't stored independently, managing the state and transitions required a lot of custom handling.

7. **_How do you approach debugging and optimizing React applications?_**  
   I use React Developer Tools, `console.log`s, and the `debugger` keyword to trace component behavior. I profile performance, refactor components, and use memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, etc.) where needed.

8. **_Have you worked with state management in React (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, MobX)? If yes, how?_**  
   Yes, I’ve used both Redux Toolkit and Zustand. In this project, I used Zustand for lightweight state sharing across components, especially for managing selected cryptocurrency data.

9. **_What are your thoughts on component reusability and structuring a React application?_**  
   I prefer separating logic (hooks) from UI. Reusable components save time and reduce bugs in long-term maintenance.

10. **_How do you ensure good UI/UX in front-end applications?_**  
    By using design systems (like Ant Design or MUI), thinking from the user's perspective, and testing interactions on multiple devices.

11. **_Have you worked with testing frameworks in React? If yes, which ones and how do you use them?_**  
    I used to study about test framworks but i don’t have experience working with testing frameworks. I usually test my work manually before it reaches the QA team. However, I would love to work in a team that uses testing tools and has consistent documentation.

12. **_How do you handle real-time data updates in a front-end application?_**  
    Using polling, WebSockets, or tools like SWR/React Query with intervals. In this project, I used polling combined with Zustand to update chart data periodically.

13. **_Have you worked with advanced performance optimizations such as lazy loading, memoization, and virtualization?_**  
    Yes. I use `React.lazy` for route-based code splitting, `React.memo` and `useMemo` for preventing unnecessary renders, and libraries like `react-infinit-scroll` for large lists.

14. **_How do you ensure security in front-end applications, such as handling authentication and preventing XSS/CSRF attacks?_**  
    I sanitize inputs, avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML, use secure headers when available, and use HttpOnly/SameSite cookies for secure authentication.

15. **_If you had unlimited resources and time, what kind of front-end application would you build and why?_**  
    I’d build a modular UI-builder platform that allows non-devs to create responsive front-ends with a drag-and-drop interface — integrated with live preview and export features. It empowers more people to create software visually.
